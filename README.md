#employee-management-system
The goal is to build a console-based Employee Management System in Python that demonstrates understanding of:

Classes (to represent entities like Employee, Department, and Manager).

Modules (to separate functionalities like data handling, operations, and main app).

Basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

File storage for persistence (text/JSON/CSV).

This will be a mini project: simple, functional, and extendable later.
